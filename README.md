# Orders API
A PHP Laravel project to manage customers, orders and subscriptions entities.

## Why
This is my first project with Laravel.\
I tried using it to have my own opinion. 
It works like Symfony in a lot of aspects. I found it more relevant to try it because you use it.\
Laravel have a great community and support so it helps new developers to start and it evolves with PHP.

I followed Laravel documentation and best practices so it should be easy to understand the architecture

I should have wrote some units tests with more time to ensure quality...
